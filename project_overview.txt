To install a new repository, first, ensure you have Git installed on your computer, which you can download from the official Git website. Once Git is installed, you can either clone an existing repository or create a new one.

To clone an existing repository, use the following command:
git clone [repository URL]

If you are creating a new repository, navigate to your desired directory and initialize it with:
git init

After adding the files you want to include, use:
git add .

Commit your changes using:
git commit -m "Initial commit"

If you plan to push these changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub, you will need to add the remote URL with:
git remote add origin [URL]

Finally, push your changes to the remote repository using:
git push -u origin master

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
